# Memory Box

Memory Box is a web-app for collecting, organizing and presenting family memories in a fashion suitable for all ages. Initial version was built for my university web development class and features a text-only approach, hopefully i'll have time to extend this into a full self-hosted app with more types of media and timeline.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

I love hearing my grandparents stories, but they, and I, won't always be around to hear them. It's so hard to gather, organize and present family stories and artifacts. Existing solutions like FamilySearch Memories, in my opinion, fails at being friendly to non-tech savvy audiences and often is [public](https://www.familysearch.org/en/memories/find). This app is planning on filling that need.

### Design

![Design image](diagram.jpg)

A focus on minimal login to help with less technical users. Under each story users can comment to add to the stories.

    actor You
    participant Website
    actor Your_Grandma
    You->>Website: You add a story
    Your_Grandma->>Website: She adds a comment
    Website->>You: Your client gets notified of grandma's comment via WebSocket
```

### Key features

- Account system
- Posting and commenting on stories 
- Tags describing who's in the story

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Create the structure of the webpage and section where the scrollable section will be 
- **CSS** - Style it in an industry standard way so that it will be familiar to all use
- **React** - Provides interactivity, including login, posting commenting, adding tags and a trigger to load more stories
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for the functions described in the react section
- **DB/Login** - Stores login info, user-sessions, comments, and stories.
- **WebSocket** - Updates connected users with new stories and comments
